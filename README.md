#### About me 🧑
I'm Diego, I'm an Electrical Engineer at National University of Colombia, passionate for IT and now I'm a Front-end developer.

I studied Web Development at UTP (Technological University of Pereira) in the program ‘Mision TIC’. Additionaly, I took online courses of Web Development and React js on Udemy. And currently I'm taking the Introduction to JavaScript course in EPAM!

I'm pretty good at teamwork because in my last job, as engineer, I had to work with other professionals. Also, I can say that I'm quite creative and I have good problem-solving skills too. In ‘Mision TIC’ program with my team, we worked on two projects. The first one, a Trevel blog made with HTML, CSS and vanilla JS called “Nomada_”. And the second one, we developed a web app por Books swapping called “Arcabook”, made on React js. In both projects I worked as the Front-end dev and we used the SCRUM methodology.

I want to say that I have good knowledges and skills on HTML, CSS/Sass, JavaScript and React js. And I have a B2 level in English and French.

I'm very excited for start my career on IT as a developer!
